# Optimization Methods

The aim of this project is to test algorithms for hyperparameters global optimization based on Bayesian global optimization for study the result on a simple Convolution Neural Network LeNet5 inspired. 

## System requirements
+ install pytorch `https://pytorch.org/tutorials/`
+ install these Python packages: bayesian-optimization, tensorboardX 
+ eg. `pip install tensorboardX`
+ install Optunity: `git clone https://github.com/claesenm/optunity.git'`
`pip install optunity`

## Usage
+ download the project:
`git clone https://github.com/iacopoerpichini/OptimizationMethods.git`
+ enter in the project directory:
`cd OptimizationMethods`
+ (modify and) run: `optimization.py`
